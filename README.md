# kt-starbound-universal
__Highly Experimental__!

This is another attempt to make a Kotlin Starbound library. This differs from the usual kt-starbound in that it
attempts to avoid having dependencies on the JVM in as much of main functionality as possible, thus hypothetically
allowing it to be compiled to other Kotlin backends, such as JavaScript. In practice, this is not yet achieved.
